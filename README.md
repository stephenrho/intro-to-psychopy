# Materials for Introduction to PsychoPy workshop

This is work in progress... Currently these materials provide a basic introduction to `psychopy`. I plan to add more advanced topics, such as eye tracking and triggers, in the future...

## Installing PsychoPy

PsychoPy3 standalone app: https://github.com/psychopy/psychopy/releases

## Slides and Examples

The `python-intro.html` slides cover a very basic introduction to `python` (the essentials of what you'll need to use the psychopy module).

The `psychopy-intro.html` slides give an introduction to `psychopy` and work through an example in the `examples` folder, `recognition.py`.

There are two other examples, `cued-recall.py` and `color-wheel.py` that demonstrate other functionality. We will scroll through these at the workshop and discuss what each part of the script does.
